# Copilot / AI agent instructions (concise)

This repository is currently minimal. The only tracked paths discovered are:

- `test` — a small placeholder file containing the text `test`.
- `.git/` — repository metadata.

Because the codebase is effectively empty, follow these rules when making changes or scaffolding work:

1. Repository state
- Treat the repo as an empty Python API project. Do not assume frameworks (Flask/FastAPI/Django) are present.
- If you add code, prefer `src/` or `app/` as the top-level package directory (example: `src/myapi/`).

2. Files to add / look for
- Add a `README.md` with run/build instructions when you introduce runnable code.
- Add `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` to declare dependencies. Prefer `pyproject.toml` for new projects.
- Place tests under `tests/` and use `pytest` as the default test runner.

3. Development workflow (what an AI agent should do)
- Before implementing features, open an issue or request clarification from the repo owner if requirements are ambiguous.
- When scaffolding, include a minimal runnable example and a short `README.md` showing how to run it locally.
- Add CI hints only after the owner confirms the preferred CI (GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, etc.).

4. Code/PR style guidance for this repo
- Keep changes minimal and self-contained; prefer small commits with focused messages.
- When adding example endpoints, include a tiny test that demonstrates the endpoint behavior.

5. Integration points & assumptions (discoverable)
- No external integrations or services are observable in the repository as-is.
- If you add integrations (databases, external APIs), add configuration via environment variables and document them in `README.md`.

6. When merging or updating existing Copilot/agent guidance
- If a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` already exists, merge by preserving any owner-written sections and append/update facts about current repo state.

7. If you need to make larger scaffold changes
- Propose the scaffold in a short plan (3–6 bullets) and request confirmation before committing.

If anything here is unexpected, or you intended a different project to be present, please tell me what to look for (other branches, subfolders, or a different path). I'll re-scan and update these instructions.
